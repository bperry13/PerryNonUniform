# PerryNonUniform
For this assignment you will be writing code to generate test data and benchmark 
sorting algorithms on it (edited from Sedgewick and Wayne: 2.1.36). Already 
provided for you is BaseNonUniform.java which con- tains the existing sorting 
algorithms. This class extends an interface called SER222_02_01_HW02_Submission 
which deÙè∞Énes all of the methods that you need to create. You may create 
additional private helper methods.
